 Face Mask Prediction ðŸ˜·

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not from images. It's designed as a computer vision solution for safety compliance, especially in public health scenarios like COVID-19.

##  What This Project Does

- Classifies images into two categories: **Masked** and **Unmasked**
- Uses a trained CNN model to perform predictions on new image inputs
- Loads test data and shows predicted output with a label
- Useful as a baseline or demo for real-time mask detection systems

##  Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `TensorFlow` / `Keras` â€“ for building and loading the CNN model
  - `OpenCV` â€“ for image processing and real-time display
  - `Matplotlib` / `NumPy` â€“ for visualization and data handling
  - `PIL` â€“ for image input/output
